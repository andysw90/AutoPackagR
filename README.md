# Automatic package installer
Exploring a (probably terrible) idea to scans an R source file for functions, and installs any packages required to use those functions. If a function could belong to multiple packages it asks the user for guidance. Currently only works for CRAN packages. 

### Requires:
Collidr library (will be added as dependancy to package)
